# Get 100 trending public repos on GitHub.

### For every language, I calculated the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:

1. Number of repos using this language
2. The list of repos using the language

# How it works?

1. git clone https://github.com/MoEssam/Trending-Repos-from-Github.git
2. npm i (to install all required dependencies)
3. duplicate dotenv file and rename to .env
4. run the project using npm start
5. go to http://localhost:3000/repos
6. a new file named 100 trending repos.json will be created containing the desired results
